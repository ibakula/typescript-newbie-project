# Introduction
This is a test Front-end project. 
This project contains three components written in React just as a test for this specific project.
As I was learning HTML, CSS, React, TypeScript, Webpack, Git, JavaScript in depth and being completely new to typescript but wishing to use TypeScript with React, I decided to create a project which uses TypeScript for typechecking and compilation, Webpack for project building and Jest for writing tests.
