# Introduction
This is a test Front-end project. 
This project contains three components written in React just as a test for this specific project.
As I was learning HTML, CSS, React, TypeScript, Webpack, Git, JavaScript in depth and being completely new to typescript but wishing to use TypeScript with React, I decided to create a project which uses TypeScript for typechecking and compilation, Webpack for project building and Jest for writing tests.

# Usage
To run a development server:
* npm run test - runs a development server on **localhost:3000**
* npm run build - compiles a project into the **"projectRootDir/build"** folder

# Features
Development server uses live reload plugin to reload the website with new changes.

# Tools list
* TypeScript (tsc for typechecking and ts-loader for the bundler - webpack)
* Webpack (For bundling files together, handling and emitting assets)
* Jest (For running tests with react-dom/utils, react-test-renderer or react-testing-library)
